CVE-2020-28002
==============

[Current Desprition](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-28002)
In SonarQube 8.4.2.36762, an external attacker can achieve authentication bypass through SonarScanner. With an empty value for the -D sonar.login option, anonymous authentication is forced. This allows creating and overwriting public and private projects via the /api/ce/submit endpoint.
(It is already fixed.)

[Introduction to SonarQube](./../SonarQube/README.md)

### Who uses SonarQube
SonarQube is used and loved by 300,000+ organizations.
* Barclays
* IBM
* Microsoft
* Cisco
* ...

### What is the real-world impact
All these organization's code is in danger. From an attacker's perspective, products like SonarQube become attractive because they store or have access to all the source code of an organization's applications, thus it is more profitable to attack a link in the DevSecOps process than the application itself. All these orginazations are in danger and then all customers of these originizations are in danger.


### Detailed Information
[Video Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn9sQC3rYC8)

SonarQube ID information

* Server ID: 32FADB56-AXRx4wuyUe_xmLIBDkFu
* Version: 8.4.2.36762
* Date: 2020-10-22

When the SonarQube system is mounted for the first time , without prior authentication they will not be able to find any access to create a project or analyze it, they only have visibility over those that have been left publicly exposed ( so far, good ), however, this behavior does not it is fulfilled to the letter, since an external party can create anonymous projects and additionally overwrite existing projects, whether public or private, and best of all, without authentication.

In local or with any of the possible integrations, when we need to scan the project, we are asked to indicate at least the following parameters to SonarScanner :

* sonar.projectKey= Name of the project to analyze
* sonar.sources= Path where the code is located
* sonar.host.url= SonarQube server URL or by default call SonarCloud.io
* sonar.login= Username or connection token
* sonar.password= Required if used in conjunction with sonar.login

In the above, basic or token authentication is contemplated, and it is reasonable to think that without providing a correct token or an adequate login and password, it is not possible to carry out an analysis or upload information to the server:

For example: 
sonar-scanner.bat -D"sonar.projectKey=test" -D"sonar.sources=." -D"sonar.host.url=http://localhost:9000" -D"sonar.login=f82ed59434b9f827be05dccd0fa4e10db90d9649"

![Success](./images/PublicSuccess.png)

If we scan the project with an empty login without the password parameter in the current version(9.3), it looks like:

![Not Authorized](./images/PublicNotAuthorized.png)

Indeed, the response tells us that we do NOT have authorization for the analysis or project creation actions. But in version 8.4.2.36762, it can bypass the authorization and have the following response.

sonar-scanner.bat -D” sonar.projectKey = anonymous_project ” -D” sonar.sources= . ” -D” sonar.host.url= http://192.168.0.56 ” -D” sonar.login= “


![Bypass Authorization](./images/CVE1.png)

Validating the logs and internal tasks in SonarQube , it can be seen that the project previously created without authentication was assigned by the anonymous user :

![anonymous user](./images/CVE2.png)

The normal behaviour should be from the user you logged in, for example, if you login as admin

![admin user](./images/PublicSubmitterAdmin.png)

The next step is to check if it is possible to have the same behavior but with a private project , which, being private, is not listed or accessible by default, it requires privileges and an authenticated user:

* Name: private_project
* Visibility: private
* Creator: admin

![private project](./images/CVE3.png)

In version 8.4.2.36762, if we indicate projectkey to "private_project" and leave the login empty like:

    sonar-scanner.bat -D” sonar.projectKey = private_project ” -D” sonar.sources= .” -D” sonar.host.url= http://192.168.0.56 ” -D” sonar.login= “

![private project success](./images/CVE4.png)

The successful response from the Sonar-Scanner indicates that it has been possible to analyze, upload and replace the existing private project without having credentials or permissions. Since the project is private and is not exposed, it is necessary to validate it with an application user and see that the analysis and overwriting of the project was carried out.

Checking again the logs and the tasks created for this project, it is observed again that the action performed was assigned to the anonymous user :

![private project anonymous user](./images/CVE5.png)

The noraml behaviour should be not authorized if the login is empty and the submitter should be the login user.

![private not authorized](./images/PrivateNotAuthorized.png)

Let us see a correct sample scan in the current version (9.3).

General security considerations
-------------------------------
* An attacker can overwrite public and private projects, resulting in potential code injection at this step in the agile process.
* In a DevSecOps process , where all continuous development and continuous deployment platforms are integrated and connected to each other to allow a small change at the code level to be reflected in production in a matter of minutes, disrupting trust, security and code in one step of the process would have repercussions at the level of the entire scheme.
* SonarQube supports WebHooks, so reparsing can be used to leverage triggers to other embedded platforms.


These behaviors listed in this publication are due to an insecure configuration established in the /api/CE/submit endpoints of the SonarQube product api, the description indicates the following:
